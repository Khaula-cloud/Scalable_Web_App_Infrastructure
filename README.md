# Linux System Hardening Automation

A DevOps automation project that secures a Linux server using a single Bash script by applying industry-standard hardening practices.



## Project Overview

This project automates the process of securing a fresh Linux system using a fully scripted approach. It reduces manual configuration steps and ensures consistent security hardening across environments.

Instead of manually configuring SSH, firewall rules, and security tools every time a server is created, this script performs everything automatically in one execution.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Manually securing Linux servers is:

Time-consuming
Error-prone
Inconsistent across environments
Difficult to scale in cloud infrastructure

In real-world DevOps environments, teams manage dozens or hundreds of servers, making manual hardening impractical and risky.

## ⚙️ Solution
This project provides an automated Bash-based solution that:

Standardizes server security setup
Reduces human error
Ensures repeatable deployments
Works across new Linux instances.

## 🧠 Why Automation Matters (DevOps Perspective)
Automation is a core principle of DevOps because it enables:

- ⚡ Faster infrastructure provisioning
- 🔐 Consistent security enforcement
- 📦 Scalable system configuration
- 🧪 Repeatable and testable deployments
- ☁️ Cloud-ready infrastructure practices

In production environments, manual setup does not scale—automation is mandatory.

## ✨ Features
- Automated system updates
- Secure non-root user creation
- Firewall configuration using UFW
- Intrusion prevention via Fail2Ban
- SSH security hardening (production-ready logic)
- Logging support (optional extension)
- Modular and scalable Bash script design
## 🧰 Tech Stack

- 🐧 Linux (Ubuntu / WSL)
- 🐚 Bash Scripting
- 🔐 UFW Firewall
- 🛡️ Fail2Ban
- ⚙️ Systemd Services
- 📦 APT Package Manager

## ⚙️ How to Use

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Khaula-cloud/Linux-System-Hardening-Automation.git
cd Linux-System-Hardening-Automation/linux-hardening

chmod +x harden.sh
sudo ./harden.sh
```

## 📸 Output Example

- System updated successfully
- New user created
- Firewall enabled
- Fail2Ban installed
- System hardened

## 📈 Future Improvements
- Convert Bash script to Ansible playbook
- Add configuration file (YAML-based inputs)
- Integrate logging system
- Add rollback mechanism
- Deploy on AWS EC2 for real-world testing
- Add CI/CD pipeline for validation
